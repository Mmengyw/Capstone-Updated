# UC Berkeley Capstone Project

Developing object detection and depth prediction tools that use cameras and radar sensors to detect obstacles in the vehicle's path. Developing sensor fusion algorithms for accurate perception under harsh conditions.

Tasks:
- Performed image segmentation on camera video stream and label each pixel with the type of object it represents
- Predicted the depth of each pixel in the video stream and create a depth map for each frame in the video
- Converted the depth values into meters using experimental data
- Develop a frame wise 3D point cloud for each frame using the pinhole camera model and camera parameters
- Convert the 3D point cloud to a 2D top down view with only the objects of interest (car, bicycle, pedestrain, etc.)
